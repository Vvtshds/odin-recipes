        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This General Tao chicken tastes the same as the one served in Chinese restaurants, without the deep frying. Serve on steamed jasmine or basmati rice.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
            <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>            
        </ul>
        <h4>Sauce:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup chopped green onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
            <li>¼ cup oyster sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Coat chicken pieces with cornstarch in a bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl until combined. Stir in flour and baking powder until no large lumps remain. Mix in chicken pieces until evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until golden brown and no longer pink on the inside, about 12 minutes. Set chicken aside; keep warm.</li>
            <li>Make sauce: Reduce heat to medium-high; add green onion, ginger, and sesame oil to the skillet. Cook and stir until onion is limp and ginger begins to brown, about 1 minute. Pour in water, sugar, and vinegar; bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Dissolve cornstarch in soy sauce in a small bowl and stir into vinegar mixture along with oyster sauce and ketchup. Cook until sauce has thickened and is no longer cloudy. Stir in chicken; simmer until heated through.</li>
        </ol>
